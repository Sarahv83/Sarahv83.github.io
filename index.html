<p>Its a cool & dry morning across most of northwest Oregon and southwest Washington. Dense fog has settled in along much of the coast, and is surging up the Columbia River. Some patchy fog & low clouds will be possible in the metro area for a couple hours, but should mix out pretty quickly. Visibility should also improve along the coast as a weak cold front approaches. Unfortunately, this cold front is not going to bring much precipitation along with it, but subtle changes to our weather will occur later on. Expect increasing cloud cover and a breezy northwest wind. Highs will only make it into the mid 70s across the metro area.
